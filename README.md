PCRI Charts
--------------

This repository is for the charts that I made using Matplotlib for the Data Description paper, here at PCRI.

I am limited by the virtual machine that I write this code in; I only have access to the libraries that are provided in the basic installation of Anaconda. Otherwise I would need to requisition the addition of more libraries (a painstaking, and ultimately futile process.)

I tried to instill a little bit of thought into these charts - I tailored them to look less like the traditional Excel/Matplotlib defaults.
